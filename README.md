Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms Threaded: A collection of sparse matrix containers and manipulators, along with certain linear algebra operations for use in solving partial differential equations. The main focus is on providing all low-level kernels required to implement solvers for large sparse linear systems of algebraic equations, in an object-oriented framework.

Currently, some sparse BLAS operations are just wrappers around corresponding Intel MKL functions; MKL is a dependency.
